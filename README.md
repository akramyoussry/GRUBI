# GRUBI
This is the implementation of the proposed method in https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08023 for modeling and control of a reconfigurable photonic circuit using deep learning.

The subfolder real_valued includes the implementation of the main setting, where we can only measure power distribution at the output. The subfolder complex_valued includes the implementation for the fully-quantum setting where we can measure phases at the output indirectly using interferoemter measurements.
